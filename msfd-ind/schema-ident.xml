  <gns:description xml:lang="en">
    The Article 8 assessments on state and pressures, indicating progress towards achieving GES, and on
the economic and social analysis, are typically informed by indicator assessments which draw from
the available monitoring data in a structured manner for each assessment topic. The indicators can
cover all aspects of the DPSIR framework, where there may be indicators related to the analysis of
the main characteristics, others related to the analysis of pressures and impacts and others related to
the socioeconomic analysis. Similarly, progress in achieving the Article 10 targets is to be measured
through associated indicators. Typically, the indicator assessments provide detailed information
including the matrices, metrics and methods used, as well as the results. Selected information from
each indicator assessment (e.g. elements assessed, values and trends) can be used to populate the
XML reports.
